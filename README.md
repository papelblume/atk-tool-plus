# ATK Peripheral Tool

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/noosxe/atk-tool.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/noosxe/atk-tool)

`atk-tool` is a modular Golang library and command-line utility for querying and interfacing with **ATK gaming peripherals** (focusing on mouse telemetry like battery status and voltage).

It is structured both as a reusable Go library that can be integrated into other projects and as a standalone CLI tool.

---

## Features

- **Telemetry Queries:** Fetch battery charge percentage, current operating voltage, and charging status (wired vs. wireless).
- **Deduplication:** Merges multiple HID interface/endpoint paths into single logical devices.
- **JSON Outputs:** Native structured JSON output formats for seamless scripting and dashboard integration.
- **Highly Modular:** Centralized device registry for easy support expansion of additional models.
- **Subcommand Aliases:** Fast, intuitive CLI commands powered by Cobra (e.g. `atk-tool battery`).

---

## Supported Devices

Currently, the following devices are supported out of the box:

- **ATK A9 Plus** — `373b:1115` (Wired Connection)
- **Nearlink Mouse Dongle** — `373b:10c9` (Wireless Receiver)

You can check the `vendor:product` ID of your own devices with `lsusb` (`373b` is ATK's vendor ID).

To request support for more devices, or to add them yourself, see the [Extending Supported Devices](#extending-supported-devices) section below.

---

## Linux Setup (udev rules)

Because this tool interacts with low-level USB HID interfaces (`hidraw`), your Linux user needs read/write permissions for the target device files. Create a udev rule to run the tool without `sudo`:

1. Create a file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-atk.rules` with the following content:
   ```udev
   # ATK / Compx USB Peripherals & Receiver Dongles
   SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="373b", MODE="0666"
   ```
2. Reload and trigger the rule configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
   ```

---

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Installation

To install the latest version of the CLI utility directly into your `$GOPATH/bin`:

```bash
go install github.com/noosxe/atk-tool/cmd/atk-tool@latest
```

### Usage

Run the utility without any arguments (or with `--help`) to view the standard help:

```bash
atk-tool
```

#### 1. List connected ATK devices
```bash
atk-tool list
```

#### 2. Get battery telemetry
```bash
atk-tool status
# OR using the alias:
atk-tool battery
```

#### 3. Output in JSON format
```bash
atk-tool status --json
```

#### 4. Target a specific device path (useful when multiple dongles are plugged in)
```bash
atk-tool status --device /dev/hidraw5
```

### Shell Completions

`atk-tool` supports generating autocompletion scripts for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.

#### Bash

This script depends on the `bash-completion` package. If it is not installed already, install it via your OS package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:
```bash
source <(atk-tool completion bash)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
*   **Linux**:
    ```bash
    atk-tool completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/atk-tool
    ```
*   **macOS**:
    ```bash
    atk-tool completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/atk-tool
    ```

#### Zsh

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment, you will need to enable it. You can execute the following once:
```zsh
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions in your current shell session:
```zsh
source <(atk-tool completion zsh)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
*   **Linux**:
    ```zsh
    atk-tool completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_atk-tool"
    ```
*   **macOS**:
    ```zsh
    atk-tool completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_atk-tool
    ```

#### Fish

To load completions in your current shell session:
```fish
atk-tool completion fish | source
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
```fish
atk-tool completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/atk-tool.fish
```

#### PowerShell

To load completions in your current shell session:
```powershell
atk-tool completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

To load completions for every new session, add the output of the command above to your PowerShell profile.

## Library Usage

You can import `github.com/noosxe/atk-tool` as a dependency in your own Go projects to scan and query ATK peripherals.

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/noosxe/atk-tool
```

### Code Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/noosxe/atk-tool"
)

func main() {
	// 1. Initialize the underlying HID library
	if err := atk.Init(); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to init library: %v", err)
	}
	defer atk.Exit()

	// 2. Scan for supported ATK devices
	devices, err := atk.Enumerate()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to scan devices: %v", err)
	}

	if len(devices) == 0 {
		fmt.Println("No supported ATK peripherals found.")
		return
	}

	// 3. Select the first discovered peripheral
	target := devices[0]
	fmt.Printf("Connecting to %s (%s) at %s...\n", target.ModelName, target.ProductName, target.Path)

	// 4. Open a connection
	dev, err := atk.Open(target)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open connection: %v", err)
	}
	defer dev.Close()

	// 5. Query telemetry data
	status, err := dev.QueryBattery()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to query battery status: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Telemetry:\n")
	fmt.Printf("  Battery level: %d%%\n", status.Percentage)
	fmt.Printf("  Voltage:       %.3f V\n", status.Voltage)
	fmt.Printf("  Charging:      %t\n", status.Charging)
}
```

## Extending Supported Devices

Adding support for new models is straightforward. You can either register them at runtime or add them natively to the source registry.

### 1. Adding Native Support (For Forks)

If you have forked the repository and wish to add support natively for all CLI and library users, you can add your device definition directly to the `defaultRegistry` slice in [registry.go](file:///home/mechsoull/Projects/atk-tool/registry.go):

```go
var defaultRegistry = []DeviceDefinition{
	// ... existing devices ...
	{
		Name:       "ATK F1 Extreme",
		VendorID:   0x2bdf,                      // Vendor ID
		ProductID:  0x0a0e,                      // Product ID
		UsagePages: []uint16{0xFF02, 0xFF04},    // Raw communication usage pages
		ReportID:   DefaultReportID,             // Command report ID (typically DefaultReportID)
	},
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the new device uses a Vendor ID different from `373b` (the default ATK Vendor ID), you will also need to add a corresponding udev rule in your Linux setup to grant user permissions for it.

### 2. Registering Devices at Runtime

If you are using `atk-tool` as a library in your own project, you can register custom models at runtime before calling the scanning/enumeration functions:

```go
import "github.com/noosxe/atk-tool"

func init() {
	atk.RegisterDevice(atk.DeviceDefinition{
		Name:       "ATK F1 Extreme",
		VendorID:   0x2bdf,
		ProductID:  0x0a0e,
		UsagePages: []uint16{0xFF02, 0xFF04},
		ReportID:   0x08,
	})
}
```
